![The Medal Money farms currently available for staking LP tokens to earn MSHARE rewards](<../.gitbook/assets/img3.png>)

To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Medal Money protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with MSHARE to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 3 months. The total MSHARE rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* MEDAL-FTM LP: 70% of MSHARE rewards
* MSHARE-FTM LP: 30% of MSHARE rewards

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of MSHARE (65K) is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly 3 months from when the MSHARE farms started on March 7th, 2022. MSHARE will always continue to print MEDAL in the Boardroom, though, as long as MEDAL remains above peg.

{% hint style="danger" %}
MSHARE reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end on June 3th, 2022 once the total MSHARE supply has been distributed.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?

When MEDAL is pegged or close to being pegged at 1 MEDAL to 1 FTM, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. Wait, you mean that if FTM pumps, MEDAL pumps with it?

**Yes!**\
\
Let's look at an example:\
\
If FTM pumps in price, it won't "outrun" MEDAL, even if nobody is buying MEDAL at that time.\
\
The farm APRs will vary in terms of USD value, but the emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stablecoin LP position, where the USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If FTM rises in USD value, MEDAL goes with it. Similarly, if FTM falls in USD value, MEDAL will be worth less in USD, **but it won’t affect the peg**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The only thing that can change the price of MEDAL in terms of its FTM value (and as such, the peg) is buying and selling it.
