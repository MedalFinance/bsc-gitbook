# Strategies

Congratulations! You've made it this far. Now that you're ready to start using Medal Finance to earn some great yields, let's look at some basic strategies you can follow as a framework for your own investment strategy. We'll break things down by complexity and relative risk, so feel free to mix and match elements according to your own level of experience, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

The strategies described here are intended only to illustrate how to use the Medal finance protocol and **do not constitute financial advice**. Always do your own research and make your own decisions with regard to how you use Medal.

### Semi-active Restaking Strategy

Once you have familiarized yourself with the Medal Finance protocol and how everything works, you might be interested to try a more active and advanced strategy to diversify your passive income streams and potentially increase yields.

One way to do this would be to buy some MEDAL and pair it with FTM to receive MEDAL-FTM LP tokens. (Refer to the [Provide LP](../helpful-guides/provide-lp.md) section for instructions on how to do this.) You can then stake those LP tokens in our [Farms](../protocol/farms.md) to earn MSHARE, which you can then withdraw on a regular basis and stake in the [Boardroom](../protocol/boardroom.md) to earn additional MEDAL when above peg and the Boardroom is printing.

### **More Complex/Active Strategies**

As the Medal Finance ecosystem grows, more complex, advanced, and active strategies will emerge. Once you fully understand the protocol and how all its mechanisms interact, feel free to experiment.

Keep in mind these fundamental aspects of the protocol when you are thinking about how to most optimally balance your portfolio:

1. The Boardroom only prints for MSHARE stakers **when the peg is above 1.01**.
2. The higher MEDAL is above peg, the **more MEDAL is printed for MSHARE stakers in the Boardroom**. This makes staking MSHARE more attractive the higher above peg we currently are.
3. Conversely, MSHARE becomes less attractive as MEDAL dips below peg.

Ultimately, the goal of an advanced user of the protocol should be to help maintain the peg. Doing so will result in the greatest rewards for not only yourself as an individual, but for every person participating in the protocol as a whole.

Strategically rebalancing your portfolio to apply buying pressure to MEDAL when below peg, or selling pressure when above peg, can be a very profitable strategy, but is not without risk. As such, this type of strategy is for experienced users only.

The easiest way to earn consistent yields with Medal Finance is always in the autocompounding vaults. Everything they do you can do manually, but require significant time for monitoring and gas fees for every transaction.
